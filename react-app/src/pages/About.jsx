                    I'm a front-end developer from New Jersey leveraging 5+ years of experience in customer service and a journey of over 2 years in studying design to bring you beautiful, customer-focused web solutions. My path started out in graphic design where I transitioned into User Interface and User Experience Design, and ultimately to taking up full-stack coding so that I can make website dreams into a reality.

                    When I'm not working I enjoy drawing, video games, Dungeons and Dragons and spending time at my local park. I love to learn and practice my skills, and I am excited to continue my journey in learning web development.
